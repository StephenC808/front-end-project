                        <div>
                          Its main function is to demonstrate the usage of the weatherapi.com API and to chart any returned data using chart JS.

                          The API is subject to the restrictions of a free account meaning historic data can only retrieved for the previous 8 days with a next day forecast.

                        <div>
                          The API can also retrieve detailed current weather conditions for most locations globally. The functionality of the current weather conditions focuses on the 32 counties of Ireland.
